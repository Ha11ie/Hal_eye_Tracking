# Hal_eye_Tracking
To make an eye tracker that sees eyes like I draw them.

I will start with a basic openCV tutorial in C++.

Where i am coming from:
I am an animator/coder/actor with college and proffessional skills in those things.  I'm getting into C++ (aced the class). Now I want to practice C++ and computer vision.  

I'm working towards a C++ job in AR/VR interface design and programming for 3D creators from CAD to animator. (AR/VR is Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality). I waant to build VR / AR tools for artists.

I happily accept tips on anything a C++ coder needs after their first serious C++ class.
 
-------------------------------------
So you know what I know already: 

I did a lot of indie full stack web development from the early 2000s (I built Symantec's intranet content management system using JavaScript, ASP, ColdFusion, MySQL, IIS, Graphic Design, UI, UX, and Coldfusion's search engine).  

Recently I have been teaching c# and unity to multi media students recently for a VR class (self taught using o'riely and unity tutorials).  

I also can occasionally get tips from my old boss from the VR lab at Sun Microsystems.  He invented the GPU (3DRAM is what we called it).  He is still more into C than C++ partly because of multiple inheritance and memory management issues ...

...(malloc? is that the word?).  Us Old VR folks still want to squeeze every nanosecond. We still need to.

Major assumptions for this project:
_________________________________
The camera will be mounted on glasses pointing at the eye with a wide angle lens so that at least the eyebrow is mostly seen.

For what I want to do with eye tracking and subtle eye expressions including eyebrow tracking speed is key.
